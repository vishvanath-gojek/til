- How to copy the data from redis server to local redis server?

- Although there are SAVE and BIGSAVE command, but still their is cool way to do.
- go to local redis server and run this command `redis-cli slaveof IP-ADDRESS-OF-OLD-SERVER 6379`
- wait for a while, it will cooy all data, you won't be able to make changes/connect while copy is in progress.
- So after this is complete run this command `redis-cli slaveof no one`
- now we have entire database copied to our local server.

- Connecting to redis cli?

- redis-cli -h IP_ADDR_OF_BOX -p 6379

- Never use `keys p_*` in production, it will block the incomming call while computation.

- Use SCAN is recommended for production, so you can use something like: â€¨
  `SCAN 0 COUNT 100 MATCH p_*`

---

- Never add column with some default value to a table in production, it blocks incoming request.

- NEVER DO THIS

```
-- read & write block until it is fully rewritten(which could take hours)
ALTER TABLE name ADD COLUMN last_update timestamptz DEFAULT now();

```

- DO THIS INSTEAD (batch update)

```
ALTER TABLE name ADD COLUMN last_update timestamptz;

do {
 numOfRowsUpdated = executeUpdate(
   "UPDATE name SET last_update = ? " +
   "WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM name WHERE last_update IS NULL LIMIT 5000)",
   now);
} while (numOfRowsUpdate > 0);


```

If you need to remove the last commit but want to maintain changes ?
```
git reset --soft HEAD^
```

If you need to ever create a foreign relation while creating a postgres migration, don't forget to include `ON DELETE CASCADE` you can't do it later, later you would need to delete child first then parent, and it would be tedious.

---

whenever you create a unique constraint on table something like 

```
ALTER TABLE school_timing
    ADD CONSTRAINT unique_row_school_times UNIQUE (school_id,school_city, start_time);
```
make sure to create a unique index on such combination while writing migration file, other we will fall into this error https://stackoverflow.com/a/54169587/6451546, in laymen terms, in above sample example, if you have a row with (school_id_A, lucknow, "08:00") and you delete it, later you can't add a row with same info, you would get not unique etc. error.
